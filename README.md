**Project 2 — Solana DeFi Adoption & User Behavior Analysis**
**Overview**

This project evaluates DeFi adoption quality on Solana by analyzing protocol usage beyond surface-level metrics like Total Value Locked (TVL).

The goal is to distinguish real usage and growth momentum from volatile, short-term capital movement.

**Problem Statement**

TVL alone does not accurately measure protocol health. High TVL may be driven by temporary incentives rather than sustained user engagement.

**Data**

1. Solana DeFi protocol activity data

2. Aggregated usage and liquidity metrics

3. Time-series protocol performance data

**Methodology**

1. Measured growth momentum over time

2. Analyzed capital stability and volatility

3. Compared protocols based on consistency of usage

4. Visualized trends in an explanatory dashboard

**Key Insights**

1. Some protocols show steady, low-volatility growth indicating real adoption

2. Others exhibit sharp inflows and outflows tied to incentives

3. Adoption quality is better measured by stability than absolute TVL

**Tools**

SQL · Python · Streamlit · DeFi analytics frameworks
